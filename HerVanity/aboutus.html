<h1>About us</h1>

<p>Her Vanity started its journey when a group of college students noticed that there were no female prodcuts accessible on campus. They wanted to see a change. After numerous attempts to change the system they decided to creat the Her vanity organization. They would take in donations of Female Hygiene Products. This later branched to Makeup, Skincare, and Haircare. We are so excited to see what is next!</p>
